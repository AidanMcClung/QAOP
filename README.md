# QAOP
The code and notebooks for the Queen's PHYS 315 Observing Project

You can download a zip file of all of the source code using the release. Please note that if you do, the folder the files are in will be called "QAOP-release". The code itself depends on being inside a folder called "QAOP", so you will need to rename your folder.

The notebooks walk through and explain the process, and it is all directed from the `MasterNotebook`. **You should open up that first.**

The code uses Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, Astropy, and Photutils, so you should download and update those packages.

There will be some components you need to get from the onQ page; an api key for nava.astrometry.net, and any sample data you are going to practice with.
