# QAOP
The code and notebooks for the Queen's PHYS 315 Observing Project

The notebooks walk through and explain the process, and it is all directed from the `MasterNotebook`. **You should open up that first.**

The code uses Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, Astropy, and Photutils, so you should download and update those packages.

There will be some components you need to get from the onQ page; an api key for nava.astrometry.net, and any sample data you are going to practice with.
