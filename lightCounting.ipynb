    "# Light Counting (Photometry) Notebook \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the big step we've been working towards!\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've figured out where each of our images is (plate solved), looked for things that might be stars (found peaks), examined those peaks in detail to see how (or if) the light was spread out, created rings encompasing each of the stars, and verified that there were no other stars in those rings that would complicate things.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a lot of work to have done, and a lot of python code to have gotten through. Now, the next step is to actually so the photometry. 'Photometry' comes from two Greek words; \"light\" and \"measure\", and in Astronomy, refers to the measurement of the Flux of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In class, you'll (have) learn(ed) that Flux has units of energy per area per time; sometimes in Janskys (Jy) or other times in a series of SI units you have to examine to know whether it's specific intensity or another derived type of value.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a relation to convert the charge read by the CCD (telescope detector) back into photon energy units, but that  involves integrating over the band of wavelengths we're using, the amount of time we exposed our detetector, and converting square pixel area into solid angles in the sky, along with possibly even more things. Thankfully, we don't have to figure out how that converts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the key to being able to actually do calculations in astronomy: Dimensionless Ratios!\n",
    "\n",
    "We could have whatever arbitrary units we wanted for a flux (as long as they were energy per area (per unit time)), such as \"AA batteries per Astrophysics: Decoding The Cosmos (Second Edition) by Judith Irwin (hardcover, largest face)\", and as long as we had another light source also measured in that bizzare unit, we could take their ratio and get a value we could compare with any other value (in our case, that will be the ratios from other points in time)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we don't have that weird of a unit;\n",
    "The value of a pixel is determined by the voltage that was read by the CCD for the associated area after it was exposed for the exposure time you chose. A pixel is a square, which is already an area, but we could use the WCS data we found to figure out a solid angle for each pixel, but that is a bit more work than we need (or want) to do. "

    "# Photometry Introduction and Process\n",
    "\n",
    "To do the photometry, we will first take the \"areas\" we defined (our apertures). We will then open up an image, and put those apertures on top of them, and sum up the values for all of the pixels inside that area. That sum will be an energy, albeit on it arbitrary (though consistent!) units, and we have the area inside of which the sum was taken, and the unit of time we exposed for. Thus, the value we have counted up is **A Flux!**\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is not the flux of our star; there is background noise in the image. If we want the Flux of a star, we need to subtract the extra energy added by the background. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background Subtraction (Tangent)\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to get rid of the background noise energy would have been to find an area with no stars, find out what the average pixel value was inside it, and then subtract that one average value from every pixel in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've instead opted for the slightly more complicated, but more accurate version. Around each of our stars, we've established a (symmetrical) area with no stars. If you remember from your electromagnetism course (or some other course that covered it), if you integrate around a point source (or any source entirely contained) there is no difference in emission between the directions (the word that would be used is \"Flux\" but I think it would be confusing to use that word given the flux from stars we're looking for). Basically, the point is, if we consider all around our source, we can figure out how much would've been inside, even if the background varies (ie, has some gradient)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background Subtraction (in practice)\n",
    "\n",
    "For our analysis, we will need to extract some specific values in order to determine the flux. We will (approxtimate to a very good degree) the background in our circle by finding **the area of that circle in pixel units**, and then finding the **average pixel value in the annulus** around it, and multiplying the two together.\n",
    "$$ F_{Background} = A_{aperture} \\times \\overline{F}_{pixel} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will determine the total flux for the aperture by counting up the pixel values inside, and we will find the flux of the star by subtracting the background flux from the total:\n",

    "## What Changes For The Real Photometry\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have noticed, that practice image isn't a real picture of the stars. There are a number of things that are different for when we do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is that we already have the definitions of the apertures. In the example above, you should have defined your aperture to be a rectangle covering the 'star'. You could have found your background either with an area around that rectangle, or any area anywhere in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the real data, we will be running for multiple images, though this is a pretty simple adaptation, and we just repeat the single image process over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, our apertures that we already created are circles, not rectangles, but the pixels we have are still squares.\n",
    "This doesn't make things impossible, but it does add the complication that we would need to deal with that somehow. One way would be to simply say that a pixel is either entirely inside the area, or outside, based on whether the centre of the pixel would be inside or outside the circle. This works well for large apertures, but ours are only a few pixels big. The next step would be to figure out how much of the pixels area is inside the circle, and then add that fraction of the pixel's value, which is the best thing I would consider trying to do manually. The hardest thing, which the package we import, does, is to not only find the area/overlap between circle and pixel, but also consider the gradient of pixel value 'inside' the pixel based on the surrouning pixels, and then integrate that function over the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other big complication is that the images move. The telescope has to move opposite the Earth's rotation in order to keep the same stars visible, and, while it is incredibly good at doing so, it is not so perfect that the stars stay on the same pixels.\n",
    "One way to deal with this would be to take all of our images, and stack them up on top of each other so that the stars stay in the same place over the whole observing session. The other way is to define everything relative to some coordinate system, and then transform between that system and each image's pixel coordinate system. This is what we have done; we added the WCS data to each image (how to get from the external coordinates to That Image's Pixel Coordinate system) and defined out apertures in this external coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also be thinking \"well, with my prior knowledge of geometric spaces and tranforms, I know that you can't directly map a sphere (the sky) onto a plane (a 2D image) without some form of distortions\". That is absolutely right, and, thankfully, other people have already figured out how that mapping is related, and, when we use the packages we do, those distortions are accounted for!"
