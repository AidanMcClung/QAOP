class photInstance:
    '''A class designed to be created in an external notebook and allow the easy use of the functionality of this module. When being created it will need to have a file of the apertures. By default it will assume this file is in the same root directory, but a path may be specified by passing it as the "apertureFilePath" parameter. An alternate directory for the module to store results can also be specified by passing the parameter "resultDir", which defaults to a folder called "photometry" in the root directory. 
    
    The primary method of the class is the runForFile() method, which takes in the filepath of the fits image it is to do the photometry one. The method automatically saves the result to a new row in the internal "Master Results Table", which is written to a file and saved after each call. As well, the method will return the dictionary of results, including the added Time column, should there be a need to use it elsewhere, though in general it is expected this will be discarded.
    
    As previously mentioned, the class has an internal "MasterTable" which stores the data in a 3D Table (Vertical is Time/File (it's meant to be time, but can have repeats), horizontal is sources (based on name), and lastly depth is the value stored (ie, aperture_raw_sum)). In the current implementation the three-dimensionality is not fully integrated into the table, and it is technically a 2D table where every cell is a dictionary. This has the drawback that one has to extract values cell-wise as it currently stands, but unpacking the data is handled by the "export" method and data can be more easily accesed there.
    
    The class also keeps a log of what it has run; it will write to this log "{IndexOfRowAdded}:{method}:{otherInformation}". As it currently stands the only possible method to add data is by using a fits file, so "file" is the only thing that will appear as "method". For files, the "otherInformation" is the path to this file. 
    (it is anticipated that future updates or external integration may use this log to avoid rerunning rows multiple times in the event of a runtime failure, but as of 07/28/2023 the info is just there and possible to be accesed by a user)
    
    NOTE: The class will open and load in previous results that are stored in the "master_table" and "master_log" files, as a way to continue in the event of a system failure. If it is desired that the entire process be started again, these files should be cleared/deleted manually before creating a new instance of this class.
    NOTE: This overwriting applies specifically and especially to any changes in the apertures. IF THE APERTURE FILE IS CHANGED between creations of the photInstance class, then the stored backup master_table file will have the WRONG NUMBER OF COLUMNS and the program will throw an error (or lots of them), so the backup must be cleared/deleted.'''
